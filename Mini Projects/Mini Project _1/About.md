Mini-Project 1:Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (VIP)

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to apply data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques on a real-world dataset to prepare it for machine learning modeling.

Instructions:

Data Collection:Choose a dataset of your choice from a reliable source or dataset repository (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other trusted source). Ensure that the dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical features.

Data Inspection:Provide a brief overview of the chosen dataset, including the number of samples, features, and the target variable (if applicable). Mention any initial observations or challenges you notice in the dataset.

Data Preprocessing:

a. Data Cleaning: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. Explain your approach and the techniques you used for dealing with missing data. 

b. Feature Scaling: Apply appropriate feature scaling techniques (e.g., Standardization or Min-Max scaling) to normalize the numerical features in the dataset.

c. Handling Categorical Data: Encode categoricalvariables using suitable techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding. Explain the rationale behind your choice.

Feature Engineering:

Apply at least two feature engineering techniques to create new meaningful features from the existing ones. Explain why you selected these techniques and how they enhance the dataset's representational power.

Handling Imbalanced Data:If your dataset has imbalanced classes (e.g., in classification tasks), address this issue using a technique of your choice (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, or any other method). Provide details on how you handled class imbalance.

Data Transformation:After completing data preprocessing and feature engineering, save the preprocessed dataset as a CSV file for further analysis. Include a link or attachment to this CSV file in your assignment submission.
Analysis:Provide visualizations and summary statistics to illustrate the impact of data preprocessing and feature engineering on the dataset. Discuss how these techniques improved the dataset's suitability for machine learning tasks.

Conclusion:Summarize the key takeaways from this assignment, including the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in preparing data for machine learning models.

Submission Guidelines:Submit a comprehensive report that includes explanations, code snippets, visualizations, and any additional insights gained during the process.Include the link or attachment to the preprocessed dataset CSV file.Ensure that your assignment is well-organized, clear, and easy to follow
